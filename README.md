# What is this?
This is a collection of mods I have made for the game [Crab Champions](https://store.steampowered.com/app/774801/Crab_Champions/) using [UE4SS](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS).
# FAQ
1. Can I get banned when using these? No. The developer does not mind modding
2. How do I install the mods? [Click Here](https://github.com/Duckos-Mods/Crab-Champions-Mods#installing)
3. Do these mods work online? I make these mods with the intent they are used in solo play but I do use them with friends online sometimes so most should work but if they do not I will not look into it!
4. How can I make mods to? 
	1. Download and install [UE4SS](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS).
	2. Dump all the Lua and Cxx bindings for the game.
	3. Use the live viewer to find function/objects
	4. Experiment! This is a very new thing for this game. It is also new to me. I have never made mods for unity games outside of astroneer which has a modding SDK already
	5. Publish! Feel free to make a PR to this github page or make a page on a place like nexus or modDB if there isnt one already! 
	6. If you need any help feel free to DM me on discord at `duckos_mods`. While im not the best I hope I can be of some use!
5. Will you be making more mods? Yes I hope! I have many ideas  I want to try and i might even try and make a modding SDK to make mods more powerfull. Thats along ways away though.  
# Installing
1. Download [UE4SS](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/releases). Download the xinput version
2. Go to your game install directory then go too `CrabChampions/Binaries/Win64/` then extract UE4SS there!
3. Go to the mods folder and put one of the mods you download from this github or any were else in there
4. Open the `mods.txt` file. And modify it to enable the mods you want and disable the mods you do not want.
	1. The `mods.txt` uses the folder name as the mod name! So if you download the Itemiser mod the line in the `mods.txt` will be `Itemiser : 1 ` to enable it and `Itemiser : 0` to disable it
5. Launch the game and have fun!
